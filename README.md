# mod6-challenge

This was a fun challenge I was able to get the weather api working by myself which gave me tons of confidence. I really liked getting the data and then using it to manipulate my page. The hardest part for me to implement was the local storage. Also it looks like i may have used the incorrect api call as the one in the challenge description, but my app still works so hopfully that isnt a problem
